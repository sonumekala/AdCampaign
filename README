To start the application, use either of the ways
From Command line prompt

2. mvn package
   mvn spring-boot:run
   
From Eclipse IDE
 Run/Debug AdCampaignApplication.java   

Developers run embedded tomcats locally, it allows faster deployment cycles and easier debugging.
When apps run in a cloud, it may be cheaper to use one tomcat for many apps.

It would be recommended to support both, creating a war for tomcat and a jar with an embedded tomcat as 
well.Use Spring and maven profiles to provide different configs for both environments.

Testing:
Test with either PostMan or Swagger.

To launch swagger , open http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html 
1.We can view all the services in the browser
